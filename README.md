# Applications

This part of your application to ScottyLabs tests your ability to follow technical specifications and use GitHub. You'll need to create a TOML file showcasing your programming projects while adhering to our formatting standards and schema validation.

Your submission should include repositories that showcase your software engineering skills and proficiency across different tech stacks. The descriptions should be a sentence that elaborates on what each project is.

Once your PR has been merged, you can see your contribution on www.scottylabs.org!

## Requirements

1. Install the recommended VS Code extensions (see ./vscode/extensions.json) (strongly recommend the TOML formatter) or the appropriate alternatives for your editor.

2. Observe the required schema format in `meta/projects.schema.json`, and use the existing files in `projects/` as references.

3. Create a TOML file in `projects/` named `your-github-username.toml`.

4. List your repositories using the required format.

5. Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard in your pull request title.

6. Ensure your file passes all CI checks, including EditorConfig compliance and TOML (schema) validation.
